## Conclusion

The global green hydrogen market is transitioning from concept to reality with **$75 billion in committed capital** and **1,572 projects** in development. The 10 projects profiled represent the leading edge of this transformation, spanning mega-scale export facilities (WGEH: 5.4 Mt/year) to operational pathfinders (Sinopec: 20,000 tons/year operational).

**Key Success Factors Emerging:**
1. **Government Support:** Egypt (33-55% tax incentives), Germany (€7B), essential for viability
2. **Offtake Certainty:** Projects with secured buyers (NEOM/Air Products, YURI/Yara) progressing faster
3. **Existing Infrastructure:** Integration with refineries, ammonia plants reducing risk
4. **Resource Quality:** World-class solar (Atacama, Egypt) and wind (Australia, Patagonia) enabling competitive costs
5. **Scale Approach:** Both mega-projects (NEOM, WGEH) and modular phased (GET H2, Cromarty) viable

**Critical Challenges:**
1. **FID Gap:** 80% of announced capacity needs investor commitment
2. **Operational Execution:** Sinopec's 20% Year 1 utilization highlights technical challenges
3. **Infrastructure Development:** Pipelines, storage, export terminals lagging
4. **Cost Competitiveness:** Must reach €1.5/kg to match grey hydrogen
5. **Timeline Management:** Delays common (HyDeal 2026→2028)

The green hydrogen industry is at an inflection point. Projects that secure offtake agreements, government support, and demonstrate operational excellence will define the pathway for the hundreds of projects in the global pipeline.
