## Executive Summary

This research compiled comprehensive financial modeling parameters and benchmarks for infrastructure projects across multiple sectors and regions. The data sources include authoritative reports from the World Bank, IFC, IEA, Lazard, S&P Global, and NYU Stern's country risk premium database.

### Key Findings:

1. **Renewable Energy IRR Ranges:** 7.5-15% depending on geography (developed markets: 7.5-12%, emerging markets: 13-15%)
2. **Infrastructure DSCR Requirements:** Typically 1.3-1.5x minimum, with water utilities accepting lower ratios (1.25x) due to stable cash flows
3. **Loan-to-Value Ratios:** Generally 70-75% for most infrastructure, up to 80% for water utilities
4. **African Risk Premium Myth:** Actual loss rates in Africa (1.7%) significantly lower than Latin America (13%) and Eastern Europe (10%), yet perceived risk remains inflated
5. **Carbon Credits:** Average $4.80/ton in 2024, but high-quality removal credits command $14.80-$20/ton

## Cost of Capital Methodology

### WACC Calculation
```
WACC = (E/V × Re) + (D/V × Rd × (1-Tc))

Where:
E = Market value of equity
D = Market value of debt
V = Total value (E + D)
Re = Cost of equity
Rd = Cost of debt
Tc = Corporate tax rate
```

### Cost of Equity (CAPM)
```
Re = Rf + β × (Rm - Rf) + CRP

Where:
Rf = Risk-free rate
β = Beta (systematic risk)
(Rm - Rf) = Market risk premium (~5% for developed markets)
CRP = Country risk premium
```

### Country Risk Premium
```
CRP = Default Spread × (σ_equity / σ_bond)

Typical Volatility Ratio: 1.42
(S&P Emerging BMI std dev / iShares JPM USD EM Bond ETF std dev)
```

**Example: India**
- Default Spread: 2.35%
- CRP: 2.35% × 1.42 = 3.34%
- Total ERP: 5% (mature market) + 3.34% = **8.34%**

2. Actual project terms depend on specific risk profile, jurisdiction, sponsor quality, and market conditions
3. IRR ranges represent both unleveraged and leveraged returns across different risk profiles
4. DSCR requirements vary by lender, project stage, and risk assessment
5. Country risk premiums are dynamic and should be updated regularly
6. Carbon credit valuations are subject to significant market volatility
7. Regulatory changes can materially impact project economics
8. Currency fluctuations in emerging markets can significantly affect returns

### Recommended Updates

📅 **Quarterly:**
- Update country risk premiums from NYU Stern database
- Monitor carbon credit prices
- Track regulatory changes in relevant jurisdictions

📅 **Annually:**
- Review sector IRRs based on transaction data
- Update cost of debt based on current interest rate environment
- Validate DSCR and LTV benchmarks against recent deals

## Key Insights for Infrastructure Modeling

### 1. Geographic Risk Mispricing
The most significant finding is the disconnect between perceived and actual risk in Africa. With actual loss rates of 1.7% versus 13% in Latin America, African infrastructure projects face inflated capital costs due to perception rather than reality. This creates arbitrage opportunities for sophisticated investors.

### 2. WACC Dominance in Renewable Energy
With WACC accounting for 20-50% of LCOE, financing costs are often more important than technology costs for renewable energy projects. Reducing cost of capital through credit enhancement, guarantees, or concessional finance can be more impactful than engineering optimization.

### 3. Carbon Credits as Material Revenue Stream
High-quality carbon credits ($15-20/ton) can improve project IRR by 0.5-2.0 percentage points. However, the 2024 market showed significant quality differentiation, with low-grade credits at $3.50/ton. Projects must target high-quality certification (Verra, Gold Standard, ICVCM) to capture value.

### 4. Sector-Specific DSCR Reflects Cash Flow Stability
The variation in DSCR requirements (1.25x for water vs 1.4x+ for transport/telecom) reflects underlying cash flow predictability. Water utilities' regulated tariffs and essential service nature justify lower coverage ratios, reducing equity requirements.

### 5. Emerging Market Premium Still Attractive
Despite risk premium compression, emerging markets (India 13-15%, Brazil 15%) still offer 3-7 percentage point IRR premiums over developed markets (US 7.5-9%, Europe 7.5-12%). For investors with local expertise and risk management capabilities, this premium compensates for genuine additional risks.
